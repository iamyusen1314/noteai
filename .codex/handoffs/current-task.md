## 1. Objective and standing authority

- Umbrella task: `PROD-COMPLETE-FIRST-LAUNCH-001`.
- Goal: internal deployment readiness `29/29`.
- Main CTO may approve finite, bounded, reversible internal-production work
  without repeated product-owner confirmation.
- Do not stop merely because a task, checkpoint, cleanup or Handoff completed.
  Continue through the dependency graph.
- Stop only for interactive login/new credentials, public DNS or real traffic,
  irreversible destruction, uncapped cost, a new product decision, public
  launch declaration, a true security conflict, a database-connected UNKNOWN
  result or genuine technical inability.
- Never print or persist Secret values, credentials, private keys, cookies,
  complete connection strings, IP addresses, cloud resource IDs, user data or
  long raw logs. Never force-push, merge directly to `main`, run concurrent
  production writes or automatically retry a database-connected failure.

- Repository/isolated readiness: `12/12`.
- Internal deployment readiness: `14/29 = 48%`.
- Public launch readiness: `14/38 = 37%`.
- Public launch completion: false.

## 3. Preserved production incident boundary

- V3B and V4 are both
  `CONNECTED_KNOWN / ROLLED_BACK / DATABASE WRITES 0 / CLEAN`.
- Never retry either database action.
- V4 passed its fresh backup/private-network/zero-residue/API checks, exact
  remote package verification, network-none import and forced-readonly
  pre-dispatch before its one apply.
- V4 returned the sanitized coarse stage `apply_runtime_acl_failed`.
- The independent forced-readonly outcome audit proved the transaction rolled
  back and all five permitted write categories were zero.
- Production therefore remains exactly:
  - ledger migrations `0001`-`0008`;
  - 30 public tables;
  - 5 public sequences;
  - 2 historical runtime roles;
  - no SHA backfill, new ledger row, new table, new role, seed, retention
    backfill or existing business-row update.
- Last independently observed cleanup baseline after V4:
  `3 accounts / 1 Super / 0 task accounts`, zero task account/key/ciphertext/
  directory/package/sentinel/result/container/process/Cloud Shell residue;
  API-C/API-F/Admin active, ready and loopback-only.
- ROOT-CAUSE-003 made no production database, cloud, service, provider or
  public-traffic action. The next production read-only task must refresh the
  cleanup and service baseline rather than inherit browser memory.
- OWNER-AUTHORITY-PREFLIGHT-004 subsequently refreshed that baseline and ran
  exactly one forced-readonly audit. It is
  `CONNECTED_KNOWN / READ_ONLY_REJECTED / ROLLED_BACK / WRITE 0`: the existing
  protected API-C Admin runtime credential received SQLSTATE `42501` at the
  fixed `migration_owner_activation` stage and cannot activate
  `noteai_admin`. The audit was not retried.
- Post-004 cleanup was independently read back as
  `3 accounts / 1 Super / 0 task accounts`, zero task material/container/
  process/Cloud Shell residue, and API-C/API-F/Admin active, ready and
  loopback-only.

Historical evidence:

- `deploy/production/evidence/production-schema-roles-v4-rolled-back-20260728.json`
  - 26 files including manifest;
  - 25/25 hashes;
  - 16 migrations;
  - 64,252 bytes;
  - deterministic archive SHA-256
    `0e16fd34404319902b1f15b9b1bccce6394f0ade5fb09ca0dd3979e1158bac5a`;
  - preflight result 3,853 bytes / SHA-256
    `66821db97930871d06fcf8538cbc0626bd820cb3e198c022f0c9d287b4bd7335`.

The older 25-file/62,275-byte package and 3,845-byte result belong to the
accepted-risk read-only audit, not V4.

## 4. First-launch accepted risks

- Exactly two zero-credit accepted risks remain active:
  - the existing `noteai_xhs -> noteai_admin` row is
    `ADMIN TRUE / INHERIT FALSE / SET FALSE`;
  - `noteai_app ROLINHERIT` has incoming membership 0 and high-privilege
    inheritance 0.
- They are `ACCEPTED_RISK`, never `VERIFIED_FIXED`, and are reviewed 30 days
  after first public launch.
- They authorize no new `noteai_xhs` role, membership, ADMIN OPTION, DDL,
  ownership, role management or database privilege.
- Provider support remains an optional post-launch remediation, not a
  first-launch blocker.

## 5. Completed unique task: ROOT-CAUSE-003

`PROD-FIRST-LAUNCH-PRODUCTION-SCHEMA-RUNTIME-ACL-ROOT-CAUSE-003`

Status:
`REPOSITORY + DISPOSABLE POSTGRESQL VERIFIED / PRODUCTION UNCHANGED`.

Exact root cause:

1. Alibaba RDS PostgreSQL exposes no native PostgreSQL superuser.
2. PostgreSQL 16 always gives a NOSUPERUSER+CREATEROLE creator implicit
   `ADMIN OPTION` on each role it creates. The default empty
   `createrole_self_grant` only omits `INHERIT` and `SET`.
3. V4 created six runtime roles directly as the short-term managed-RDS
   privileged executor.
4. PostgreSQL therefore created six
   `new_runtime_role -> executor / ADMIN TRUE / INHERIT FALSE / SET FALSE`
   rows.
5. With the one accepted legacy row, the old exact-one assertion observed
   seven rows and failed inside the first runtime ACL `role_contract` block.
   Database/schema ACL was not reached.
6. The old disposable fixture used a native superuser for role creation and
   could not reproduce this managed-RDS behavior.

Corrected V5 owner contract:

- Activate persistent `noteai_admin` with `SET LOCAL ROLE` inside the bounded
  transaction before advisory lock or writes.
- Require `noteai_admin` to be non-native-superuser, have `CREATEROLE`, own the
  current database and own every existing/new public relation and function.
- Create the six new NOLOGIN roles as the persistent owner.
- Require exactly six owner management rows, each
  `ADMIN TRUE / INHERIT FALSE / SET FALSE`; they allow role administration
  but no privilege inheritance or `SET ROLE`.
- Preserve the one historical accepted-risk row separately.
- Require unexpected membership, runtime ownership, migration-owner mismatch
  and short-term-executor ownership all to be zero.
- Split runtime ACL into ten fixed sanitized stages:
  `role_contract`, `database_schema`, `clear_new_roles`, `api`, `tracking`,
  `trends`, `durable_ai`, `private_storage`, `payment`, `admin`.
- Use the new task root `/var/lib/noteai/schema-roles-v5-owner`; never reuse
  the V4 directory or runner identity.
- Distinguish `apply_transaction=committed` from
  `audit_transaction=rolled_back` in runner summaries.

  `a6cc4fef8d988adb05108edeb16d8b520f600e4fd3bac06f61812c3db24ada73`.

Disposable PostgreSQL 16 proof:

- `2/2` integration tests passed.
- The first test pinned the implicit ADMIN edge and proved the non-super
  creator cannot remove the bootstrap-granted row itself.
- The second used a distinct short-term executor, activated the persistent
  owner, completed first apply, apply-twice, independent outcome and six
  negative mutations, then actually deleted the executor.
- First apply exact counts:
  `8 SHA backfills + 8 ledger inserts + 2 fixed seeds + 0 retention +
  0 existing business updates`.
- Apply-twice: all five categories zero.
- Owner mismatch, executor-owned objects and executor residue: zero.
- Focused schema/outcome unit tests: `24/24`.

Local diagnostic failures were bounded:

- three package mount/import failures were `PRE_CONNECT`;
- two disposable SQL probes were
  `CONNECTED_KNOWN / ROLLED_BACK / WRITE 0`;
- local `CONNECTED_UNKNOWN` count was zero;
- none involved production.

## 6. Completed unique task: OWNER-AUTHORITY-PREFLIGHT-004

`PROD-FIRST-LAUNCH-PRODUCTION-SCHEMA-OWNER-AUTHORITY-PREFLIGHT-004`

Status:
`CONNECTED_KNOWN / READ_ONLY_REJECTED / ROLLED_BACK / WRITE 0 / CLEAN`.

- Source checkpoint: `51ae87784d7e1e79358d95c7336c0e12bb2e9c04`.
- Minimal package: 26 files including manifest, 25 manifest hashes,
  16 migrations, 64,889-byte deterministic gzip,
  SHA-256 `f872ed201597e902ac91b8cbced3f41f829c95f0ac254b4bc30512ff5b794f51`.
- Local zero-DSN import, remote `25/25` hashes and remote network-none import
  all passed before database dispatch.
- Fresh control-plane and host checks proved one running private RDS,
  a successful full backup younger than 48 hours, `3/1/0` accounts, zero task
  residue and healthy loopback-only API-C/API-F/Admin.
- Exactly one audit established one database connection and a repeatable-read,
  read-only transaction. It failed deterministically at
  `migration_owner_activation` with SQLSTATE `42501`, then rolled back.
- Result bytes were zero; the sanitized error artifact was 218 bytes.
  Database writes, role changes, business-value reads and automatic retries
  were all zero.
- The owner-contract and production-state aggregate queries were not reached,
  so this audit does not claim a fresh ledger read. The known rollback and
  zero-write result preserve the last independently proven production state
  at `0001`-`0008`.
- The exact fixed task directory, package, sentinels/results/errors, containers,
  processes and Cloud Shell task state were removed. Final account state was
  `3/1/0`; API-C/API-F/Admin remained active, ready and loopback-only.

Secret-free evidence:

`deploy/production/evidence/production-schema-owner-authority-preflight-known-failure-20260729.json`

This database action must never be retried. Its result only rejects the
existing runtime Admin credential as an owner-activation executor.

## 6.1. Completed unique task: PRIVILEGED-OWNER-PREFLIGHT-005

`PROD-FIRST-LAUNCH-PRODUCTION-SCHEMA-PRIVILEGED-OWNER-PREFLIGHT-005`

Status:
`VERIFIED_READ_ONLY_CLEAN / CONNECTED_KNOWN / ROLLED_BACK / WRITE 0`.

- Production used exact pushed source `7c4204f`; the final deterministic
  package contained 26 source files plus manifest, 16 migrations, 67,915
  bytes, manifest SHA-256 `e359e44b…4439` and archive SHA-256
  `66af35f6…0fc6`. Local top-level zero-DSN import, all hashes and remote
  network-none import passed.
- Fresh baseline proved one running private PostgreSQL instance, two
  successful full backups within 48 hours, accounts `3/1/0`, two API nodes
  with no public address, API-C API/Admin and API-F API active/ready and
  loopback-only, and zero task residue.
- One short-term managed-RDS privileged account and one API-C-only RSA keypair
  were created. Plaintext credential files, environment, argv and logs were
  zero; provider automatic retry was disabled.
- Exactly one database audit ran. It proved the executor is a non-native
  superuser with exactly one direct managed-privileged membership, no other
  direct/owner/runtime membership or object/shared dependency, and can
  activate `noteai_admin`.
- The activated persistent owner is non-superuser+CREATEROLE, owns the
  database and all existing public objects, and has the required schema
  grantable CREATE capability with owner mismatches zero.
- The same read-only snapshot independently re-established exact production
  state: ledger `0001`-`0008`, 30 tables, 5 sequences, no ledger SHA column,
  2 historical runtime roles, the exact two accepted-risk findings, no
  high-privilege app inheritance, no retention source and no task-role
  residue.
- The audit result was 4,111 bytes / SHA-256
  `fad95eaaa743ae6d87de75ead76468c1fe971c6bc829c0ba1dad7a154482ad2e`.
  A separate host-only validator checked its hash and complete fixed field
  matrix. The database transaction rolled back; writes and business-row value
  reads were zero. This database action is permanently no-retry.
- All packaging, shell, route, cleanup and Cloud Shell transport failures were
  independently proven `PRE_CONNECT` with database connection, transaction
  and write zero, then materially corrected without repeating a database
  action.
- Cleanup saved and hashed the result first, read back containers/processes
  zero, deleted the short-term account once with provider retry disabled,
  restored accounts `3/1/0`, then deleted RSA/ciphertext/source/result/
  sentinel/error/task-root and Cloud Shell task files/variables. Final RDS
  public endpoint and public API-node counts are zero; API-C/API-F/Admin remain
  active, ready and loopback-only.

Secret-free evidence:

- `deploy/production/evidence/production-schema-privileged-owner-preflight-local-20260729.json`
- `deploy/production/evidence/production-schema-privileged-owner-preflight-remote-prepare-20260729.json`
- `deploy/production/evidence/production-schema-privileged-owner-preflight-verified-20260729.json`

005 receives zero readiness credit because it is a capability preflight.
Internal readiness remains `14/29 = 48%` until V5 commits and passes an
independent complete outcome audit.

## 6.2. Unique next task

`PROD-FIRST-LAUNCH-PRODUCTION-SCHEMA-ROLES-V5-OWNER-001`

Execution class:
separately named authenticated production single-transaction incident.

Stage-safe runner stabilization:

- `tools/production_schema_roles_runner.sh` now uses the production-proven
  `/task/tools` Python path and top-level imports in both network-none prepare
  and database modes, eliminating the installed-image namespace collision.
- Preflight, apply and outcome results are parsed as structured JSON and must
  match exact task, rollback/commit, write-count, role, risk and zero-external-
  action fields. A tampered retention write count is rejected by an executable
  validator test.
- The apply mode revalidates the saved preflight structure before writing.
  Grep-only result acceptance is removed.
- Task/source/key/ciphertext ownership, modes, symlink count and hard-link
  counts are fail-closed. Every prepare, preconnect, known, unknown and success
  terminal summary keeps `cleanup_required=1` until external cleanup readback.
- New runner SHA-256:
  `790e5ad175c970a9b79b646beb0085df77c5a64cb1425da167e10a6ed0900b10`.
- Executor, outcome auditor, preflight auditor, runtime ACL and all migration
  bytes remain unchanged. Focused tests pass `29/29`; runner syntax,
  top-level zero-DSN import and diff checks pass.
- This repository-only step made zero production database, cloud, account,
  service, provider or public-traffic action and receives no readiness credit.

Required path:

1. Commit and push the hardened runner source checkpoint, then build a fresh deterministic
   minimal package from that exact commit. Do not reuse 005 or V4 package,
   account, RSA, root, runner identity or result.
2. Repeat only the production-write prerequisites: fresh backup/private
   network/`3/1/0`/zero-residue/service checks, all hashes, zero-DSN and
   network-none imports.
3. Create one fresh short-term managed-RDS privileged account and fresh
   API-C-only RSA material with the same protected-input boundary.
4. Run one fresh forced-readonly V5 pre-dispatch proving exact ledger
   `0001`-`0008`.
5. Execute V5 apply at most once. The only permitted writes are
   `8 legacy SHA backfills + 8 new ledger rows + 2 fixed seeds`;
   retention backfill and existing business-row updates must be zero.
6. Any database-connected apply failure is permanently no-retry. Preserve the
   result and run only the predeclared independent forced-readonly outcome
   classifier.
7. Require a deterministic `COMMITTED` outcome plus the complete ledger SHA,
   inventory, role/table/column/sequence/function/default-ACL negative matrix,
   zero elevation and exact write counts before marking
   `production_schema_roles` verified.
8. Save Secret-free evidence, restore accounts `3/1/0`, delete all task
   material, read back services/network/residue, checkpoint/push, then
   continue to the dependency graph without stopping.

## 7. Mandatory failure classification

After any nonzero exit or tool failure, collect Secret-free sentinels,
process/container counts, connection/transaction state and result evidence:

1. `PRE_CONNECT`: prove database connection, transaction and write are zero;
   clean exact material; continue only after a material correction.
2. `CONNECTED_KNOWN`: preserve the deterministic result, never retry that
   database action, complete required cleanup and continue only with a
   separately authorized non-retry path.
3. `CONNECTED_UNKNOWN`: no automatic retry or new database action; preserve
   evidence, clean and stop at that incident boundary.

Read-only diagnosis, process/container/sentinel inspection, connection-count
checks and cleanup do not count as retries and are mandatory after failures.

## 8. Verification and checkpoint requirements

Completed verification:

- focused privileged-owner/readiness tests: `31/31`;
- disposable PostgreSQL 16 privileged-owner chain: `1/1`;
- full Python suite: `1055/1055`, 27 explicit skips;
- production readiness gate: `105/105 PASS`;
- internal readiness: fail-closed `14/29 = 48%`;
- public readiness: `14/38 = 37%`;
- zero-DSN import, Python compile, runner shell syntax, JSON parses and
  `git diff --check`: pass;
- disposable PostgreSQL containers/network/volume: zero;
- temporary package removed from active paths and Colima restored stopped;
- 004 production database connection: one forced-readonly transaction,
  terminal rollback, database write zero;
- 004 account/cloud/service/provider/public-traffic mutations: zero.
- 005 production database connection: exactly one forced-readonly transaction,
  terminal rollback, independently validated 4,111-byte result and database
  write zero;
- 005 final cleanup: accounts `3/1/0`, task account/RSA/ciphertext/package/
  result/container/process/Cloud Shell residue zero, RDS/API public endpoints
  zero, API-C/API-F/Admin active/ready/loopback-only.

ROOT-CAUSE-003 was committed and pushed normally at `ed5e699`.
The 004 source was committed and pushed normally at `51ae877`.
The 004 outcome/evidence was committed and pushed normally at `8a533ac`.
The 005 production source/import fix was committed and pushed normally at
`7c4204f`.

Current remaining steps:

- commit and push the 005 verified outcome/evidence without changing
  migration or runtime-ACL bytes;
- commit and push the hardened V5 runner checkpoint;
- build V5 from that exact pushed checkpoint, refresh only required read-only
  prerequisites, create fresh protected account/RSA material and run its
  preflight/apply/outcome chain with at most one apply transaction;
- independently verify V5, update readiness, then continue to the unique next
  dependency without stopping at the checkpoint or task boundary.
